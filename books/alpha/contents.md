# Preface

# Chapter

I wake up and shortly afterwards read the small white piece of paper on my bedside table.

It seems today's instructions are relatively simple: All I have to do is take out the trash. What possible harm could there come from that? Maybe don't ask questions like that, you've said the same thing many times before...

Routines, routines, have to stick to my routines. Breakfast, lunch and dinner, have to be in the right order. So when does the trash have to be taken out? Does it matter? Oh, it always matters doesn't it? Well the most reasonable solution would be to dump the trash after each meal, yes, yes, that seems the ideal option. Enough times to make a statement if being observed, while certainly satisfying any minimal bounds. Excellent, well that's decided so then I must generate some actual trash.

For breakfast, I choose to discard the crusts off of my toast. A reasoned option no less. Never liked them that much anyways, how much can be ascertained about me from crusts. What kind of bread do I have though? Plain white, hmmm, no matter. That's enough disclosure about breakfast, no more observable thinking until my next meal.

For lunch, I am going to eat last night's leftovers and dispose of a chicken carcass. How clean does the carcass need to be? As dutifully as can be accomplished before my usual lunch time I say. With a knife and fork, toothpicks in hand, I go to work on the remains of last night's meal.

For dinner, ...

# Chapter

Even if I recall writing two distinct notes in the night, there only ever seems to be a single note in the morning. Occasionally multiple items might find themselves summarized on a single note, but this has been exceedingly rare. The day starts and ends usually with a single missive.

# Chapter

*Wakes up and starts reading a blue paper*

Highly unusual. It's an almost exact replica, but in blue today. Surely can't have been me, someone must have snuck in here and replaced the sheet. To do so without being noticed means it's that important a message. But how awful a request, other requests that have clearly been written by outsiders that have made their way to my bedside have incurred or inflicted only a single day's worth of damage. In the grand scheme of the mundi, they have been inconsequential but this here is not.

    "Speak a prayer every single day."

Whom is this for? What purpose does it entail? Clearly it's been left here by some religious zealot who seems to understand a semblance of my gifts. What even is the nature of prayer, aaargh, I only have today to figure all this out before I have to start. And I have to start. I have no choice. I've never had any choice in the matter.

Well I have to resort to what I know. What gods to speak of am I versed with in any sense. The Original Rebecca? That would be fine if I were a Rebecca. The Anima Mundi? The mundi is the mundi, to me there's nothing overtly spiritual about it. For all intents and purposes, prayer requires personification, a listener so to speak. Do I know any local mythos or folklore that would be more relevant? A fictional world comes to mind, the world of Bagran Molfus. I know just the prayer to use: "The universe listens." Short, sharp and to the point. It shall do, thank goodness it should only rob me of a few seconds every day to do so. With such a precious resource as time, one cannot be too lenient with it.

*BOOOM*

A rush of white paper streams in every opening of the house. I quickly try to shut the windows before they are consumed by paper. Another burst event has occurred. I've pondered why these burst events occur many times already. They seem to be a natural consequence of oneiromancers interacting with each other based on acting on their own individual prophecies. That as well as mancers and so-called spiritualists of other vocations. Where each individual little action does little to affect the overall future, they eventually accumulate and cascade to cause larger changes. But the changes backfire in on themselves to prevent future causation from being changed. This is the true nature of these bursts. One question remains is that, are these pieces of paper all magic or are they individually delivered by other masters of oneiros, or masters of other mancies?

At this point it doesn't really matter does it? I just have to stop them from suffocating me... Oh someone please help me!

# Chapter

*Wakes up and reads the white paper*

    "Speak a prayer every single day."

Again with the request from the blue paper. Am I just doing it wrong? Is my heart not in the right place? Am I saying it wrong? Perhaps I need to reflect on the prayer after doing it. Yes, yes, that seems the most reasonable next step.

    "The universe listens."

Does it really? If I say it out loud, it clearly resonates and other objects and even beings may be able to pick up the words. But isn't that just perceving not listening? Is it because the change is meant to be internal each time I say the prayer? When the universe listens, am I the embodiment? That seems a bit silly if I'm the only possible agent of change. But I guess it depends how widely I resonate the words that are being listened to. I'll never get to the bottom of this... I'll just settle for repeating it three times, that always does the trick. Then the recurring messages should cease.

    "The universe listens."
    "The universe listens."

# Chapter

I don't want to do this anymore. Don't make me do this anymore. Every morning, these words repeat themselves before I read the paper.

# Chapter

I just don't want to read it. I just don't want to read it. I don't want to get out of bed. Please god.

# Chapter

*Wakes up and reads the white paper*

    "It's time..."

The paper had seven strokes of ink in the corner and so it really seemed like it was time. So reluctantly with nothing but my pajamas, I left my house to see what was going on outside for the first time in months.

    BREAK

# Chapter

I return in my pajamas and slink back off to bed. The day is complete. All days are complete. I say my prayer, "The universe listens."

# Chapter

I don't want to leave the bed. I don't want to leave the bed. I'm not even going to read the paper today. Before I go back to bed, I say my prayer, "The universe listens."
